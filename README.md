are you scared if the libraries is too much? <br />
Don't be!
Because we are only installing one library called **<a href='https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/'>SCRAPY</a>** <br />
But to install it manually,<br />
copy and paste this **pip install scrapy** to your console. <br />
You can visit the **<a href='https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/'>SCRAPY</a>** documentation if you are curious about how it works.
